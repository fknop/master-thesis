abstract="Filtering algorithms for table constraints are constraint-based, which means that the propagation queue only contains information on the constraints that must be reconsidered. This paper proposes four efficient value-based algorithms for table constraints, meaning that the propagation queue also contains information on the removed values. One of these algorithms (AC5TC-Tr) is proved to have an optimal time complexity of O(r{\textperiodcentered}t{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}r {\textperiodcentered}d) per table constraint. Experimental results show that, on structured instances, all our algorithms are two or three times faster than the state of the art STR2+ and MDDcalgorithms.",
