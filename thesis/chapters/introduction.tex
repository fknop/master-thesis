Village n\textsuperscript{o}1 is a belgian company employing persons with disabilities.
They offer services to companies and private individuals such as industrial jobs.
They are currently in the process of automating the way they schedule these jobs. 
The aim of this thesis is to solve their resource allocation problem
automatically. First, we will introduce two models to solve this problem: a Mixed Integer Programming and 
a Constraint Programming model. We will then analyze and compare the performance of both models.

This thesis is organized as follows

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \autoref{chapter:problem} introduces the resource allocation problem of \vone.
  \item[] \autoref{chapter:sota} describes the state-of-the-art in the domains of Mixed Integer Programming and Constraint Programming. 
  \item[] \autoref{chapter:models} gives a formal definition of both MIP and CP models.
  \item[] \autoref{chapter:implementation} describes the implementation of the models.
  \item[] \autoref{chapter:experiments} presents the carried experiments and performance results of both models.
