\texttt{OscaR} \cite{oscar} is a Scala toolkit for solving Operations Research problems. 
\texttt{OscaR} has multiple optimization techniques available:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Constraint Programming
  \item Constraint Based Local Search (CBLS)
  \item Derivative Free Optimization
  \item Visualization
\end{itemize}

The project is mainly developped by UCLouvain and the research group of Pierre Schaus. But some companies like \texttt{N-SIDE} and \texttt{CETIC} allocate resources to improve it.

The library of \texttt{OscaR} in which this project is interested in is the Constraint Programming library. It offers a lot of existing constraints and abstractions. Some black-box searches are also 
implemented but we can bring our own heuristics to drive the search forward.
