\emph{OscaR} \cite{oscar} is a Scala toolkit for solving Operations Research problems. 
OscaR has multiple optimization techniques available:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Constraint Programming;
  \item Constraint Based Local Search (CBLS);
  \item Derivative Free Optimization;
  \item Visualization.
\end{enumerate*}


The project is mainly developed by UCLouvain and the research group of Pierre Schaus. But some companies like \emph{N-Side} and \emph{CETIC} allocate resources to improve it.

The library of OscaR in which this project is interested in is the Constraint Programming library. It offers a lot of existing constraints and abstractions. Some black-box searches are also 
implemented but we can bring our own heuristics to drive the search forward.
