A \emph{Constraint Satisfaction Problem} (CSP) consists of a set of $n$ variable, 
$\{x_1, \dots, x_n \}$; a domain $D_i$ of possible values for each variable $x_i$, 
$1 \leq i \leq n$; and a collection of $m$ constraints $\{ C_1, \dots, C_m \}$. 
Each constraint $C_j$, $1 \leq j \leq m$, is a constraint over some set of variables called the scheme 
of the constraint. The size of this set is known as the arity of the constraint. 
A solution to a CSP is an assignment of values $a_i \in D_i$ to $x_i$, that satisfies all of the constraints. \cite{cp-definition}
