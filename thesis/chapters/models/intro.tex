In this chapter, we first start by presenting formal notations used by both models. 
We then present two models to solve the \vone\ problem: a Mixed Integer Programming model and a Constraint Programming model.
We compare and discuss both model performances in a future chapter.

The complete notations used in these models can be found in \autoref{appendix:notations}.
