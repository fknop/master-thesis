In this chapter, we present models for both Mixed Integer Programming and Constraint Programming.
We first start by presenting constraints that need to be respected. We then present formal notations used 
by both models. The mathematical (MIP) model is presented first for reference followed by the CP model which 
is an adaptation of the mathematical model.
