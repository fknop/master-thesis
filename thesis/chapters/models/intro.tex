In this chapter, we present two models that attempt to solve the problem described in \autoref{chapter:problem}.
We first present 
a Mixed Integer Programming model followed by a Constraint Programming model.
We compare and discuss both model performances in \autoref{chapter:experiments}.

The complete notations used in these models can be found in \autoref{appendix:notations}.
