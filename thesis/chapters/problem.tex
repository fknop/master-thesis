Village n\textsuperscript{o}1 is a belgian company employing persons with disabilities.
They offer services to companies and private individuals such as industrial jobs.
They are currently in the process of automating the way they schedule these jobs. 
The company has internal work for their employees but also receives demands from external clients.
They need to assign workers for one or more time periods to those demands. They also need to assign other resources
such as vehicles, machines, locations to these demands.
Moreover, persons with disabilities have more constraints related to their working capabilities and
availabilities. The workers need specific skills and may have some restrictions which
prevent them to work for certain jobs (e.g. a worker can't lift more than five kilograms).
They also have some incompatibilities with other workers or clients making them unable to work with or for those people.
