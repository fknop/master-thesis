Set of periods:

\begin{equation*}
    T = \{ 0, \dots, n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Set of workers:
\begin{equation*}
    W = \{ w_0, \dots, w_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Availabilities of a worker:
\begin{equation*}
    w^T \subseteq T
\end{equation*}

Set of machines:
\begin{equation*}
    M = \{m_0, \dots, m_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}, m_n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Let's also define the set of machines for a given machine value (i.e name). $M_i$ is the set of machines that takes the value $i$. 

\begin{equation*}
    M_i = \{m_j \mid m_j = i,  \forall j \in M\}
\end{equation*}





Set of vehicles:
\begin{equation*}
    V = \{v_0, \dots, v_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

This could also be expressed as a subset of machines:

\begin{equation*}
    V \subseteq M
\end{equation*}

Set of zones:
\begin{equation*}
    Z = \{z_0, \dots, z_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}


Set of demands: 
\begin{equation*}
    D = \{ d_0, \dots, d_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Each with: 


\begin{itemize}
    \item $d^w \in \mathbb{N}$: Required number of workers for this demand
    \item $d^T \subseteq T$: Possible periods for a demand
    \item $d^Z \subseteq Z$: Possible zones for a demand
    \item $d^M \subseteq M$: List of required machines by the demand
    \item $d^c \in C$: Client for that demand
    \item $d^S \in S$: List of skill required by the demand (each skill need to have a different worker)
    \item $d^{s_0}$: The first skill in $d^S$
    \item $d^{S^+}$: Set of additional skills that can be satisfied by any worker in that demand
    \item $d^{S^+_0}$: The first skill in $d^{S^+}$
    \item $d^P \in \{ 0, \dots, d^w - 1 \}$: List of positions
    \item $d^O \subseteq D$: Set of overlapping demands in time for that demand. e.g. the overlapping demands for demand 1 is $d_1^O$
\end{itemize}

Set of clients: 
\begin{equation*}
    C = \{ c_0, \dots, c_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Set of skills: 
\begin{equation*}
    S = \{ s_0, \dots, s_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}

Let's also define the set of workers that satisfy a skill or skill set:

\begin{equation*}
    W_s \subseteq W, s \in S
\end{equation*}




Set of restrictions: 
\begin{equation*}
    R = \{ r_0, \dots, r_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{equation*}


Set of incompatibilities between workers:
\begin{equation*}
    {I_{ww} = \{ ({i},{j}) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \mid w_i, w_j \in W, w_i \neq w_j \}}
\end{equation*}

Set of incompatibilities between workers and clients:
\begin{equation*}
    I_{wc} = \{ (i, j) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \mid w_i \in W, c_j \in C \}
\end{equation*}
